 Trump Spent The Night Retweeting A White Supremacist Convicted Criminal,"While most of us were sleeping, Donald Trump spent his night retweeting a white supremacist who was convicted in the UK for harassing a Muslim woman in front of her two young children. Jayda Fransen was arrested in October during a neo-Nazi rally for violating terms of her bail. Fransen, Deputy Director of Britain First is thrilled to have been retweeted three times by the so-called president of the United States. Trump even retweeted a video of a boy on crutches being murdered, just in case you haven t had enough gore in your life.The former reality show star s retweets even stunned Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars editor-at-large who suggested the move was  not great optics. Yeah, someone might want to tell whoever is running Trump's Twitter account this morning that retweeting Britain First is not great optics.   Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 29, 2017Even Infowars thinks Trump went too far. Let that sink in for a moment.Here s a screen capture of the snuff film Trump retweeted.Fransen was super excited that Trump shared her anti-Muslim videos to his 44 million followers and went all caps in her tweet.

" Trump Just Got Some Really, REALLY Bad News About His Tax Returns (DETAILS)","Donald Trump has been playing games with his tax returns ever since he began his disgraceful presidential campaign. He repeatedly promised to release his tax returns after the election, but has continued to keep them a secret from the American people. Democrats and Republicans alike know that the American people deserve transparency from their president, and the latest effort to make Trump reveal his tax documents is going to send him into a rage.Two House Republicans have just joined a Democratic effort to obtain copies of Trump s tax returns, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. This is big news   and proves that not even the GOP approves of the way Trump has conducted himself.The two Republicans, Reps. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.), have added their signatures to a letter requesting Trump s tax returns from the past ten years. This letter was championed by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.)  and backed by almost every person in the 193-member House Democratic Caucus. In the letter, it is stated that Trump s tax returns would provide clarity on his conflicts of interest, which Trump has tried to hide and distract from. The letter says: Disclosure would serve the public interest of clarifying President Trump s conflicts of interest in office, the potential for him to personally benefit from tax reform, and ensure that he is not receiving any preferential treatment from the IRS.We believe the powerful and respected Committees on Finance and Ways and Means have the responsibility to ensure oversight of the executive branch by requesting a review of President Trump s tax returns and moving toward a formal release of these documents to the public. Trump s refusal to reveal his tax returns is unusual, breaking four decades in which every presidential nominee has been transparent with their tax returns. Trump tried to use an IRS audit to excuse himself, but even the IRS stated he was free to release his documents whenever he wanted to. Hopefully, this letter and the Republican senators  signatures will add enough pressure to the situation so Americans can finally know the truth about Trump.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,"Aug 12, 2017"
 WATCH: Pat Robertson Gets INCREDIBLY Offensive In Full-Throated Defense Of Trump,"How much more depraved does a so-called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real Christian?Because one would think that conservative  Christians  of all people would be absolutely opposed to Donald Trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on Friday.But evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting Trump as long as it means Hillary Clinton does not become president.Family Research Council head Tony Perkins made that clear on Saturday when he STILL voiced support for Trump despite his  grab them by the p*ssy  remark. My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the Constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years,  Perkins said.Ralph Reed of Faith and Freedom Coalition basically said the same thing. Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal. Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns. In other words, Trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative  Christian  leaders.And that includes 700 Club preacher Pat Robertson, who called Trump s behavior  macho  while continuing to endorse him for president. A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho,  Robertson said on Monday.  And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off,  Okay, he s dead, now you ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign. Robertson proceeded to declare Trump the winner of Sunday night s debate and called him  a Phoenix  rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign.Here s the video via YouTube.These hypocrites have been whining for years about how America needs a president who shares their so-called biblical values, but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the White House who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation, even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office. These people are NOT Christians. They merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"Dec 14, 2016"
 WATCH: Video Shows Cops TRYING To Run Over Black Man With Cruiser,"In something you might expect from a video game instead of real life, police in Sacramento, California are under fire on Monday after a dash cam video was released that showed police trying to run down a black man who reportedly had only a knife. They missed, but they did manage to shoot 50-year-old Joseph Mann 14 times. Now, the community is calling for the police involved to be charged with murder.The incident happened on July 11th. As those on the right will happily point out, the police were called to an apartment complex because Mann was reportedly acting erratically and he had a knife. When police ordered Mann to drop his weapon and get on the ground, Mann instead threw a thermos at the police car.That s when Officers Randy Lozoya and John Tennis came to the scene. They are the officers in the video.In the video, the officers are heard saying,  I m gonna hit him  and  Okay, go for it,  before gunning the engine and aiming for him. Mann was able to evade the police cruiser, but the officers stopped the car, got out and during a foot chase, shot Mann 14 times, killing him.Here it is: Mann was standing stationary on a sidewalk with no one in close proximity when the officers unloaded their guns,  Burris wrote in a letter he said he sent the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.The family wants murder charges filed.The officers  behaved like big game hunters closing in on an animal,  said John Burris, a lawyer for the family of 50-year-old Joseph Mann.Source: CBS NewsThe Sacramento police are reserving judgement, of course. Spokesman Matthew McPhail didn t say whether cars are permitted as weapons, but he did say,  our officers are encouraged to assess each circumstance and think critically about the tools at their disposal. The two cops have not been fired. They were placed on paid leave for a whole week after the shooting and now they are on desk duty.Again, Mann wasn t an innocent bystander. Methamphetamine was found in his system. The family s lawsuit claims that Mann was  displaying obvious signs of mental distress.  The police followed no protocol for dealing with a mentally distressed person and they made no attempt to deescalate the situation.The bottom line, though, is that the punishment did not fit the crime. If police can t even subdue a man who is armed with only a knife, how are they supposed to deal with a mass shooter or a terrorist? Not all crimes are equal and this certainly wasn t a crime that warranted the death penalty, not that police have that authority anyway.Featured image via video screen capture. ",News,"Dec 17, 2015"
 Trump Just Approved Of And Asked For MORE Violence Against Protesters (VIDEO),"What s it going to take for someone to step in and tell Donald Trump that his behavior is not okay? When will he be arrested for inciting violence against others? He is now literally saying that fighting and punching protesters at his rallies is okay. Well, guess what? It s not okay. Not by any means. Not if, even as Trump says, the protesters are  violent. At a press conference Friday morning where Dr. Ben Carson slept through his endorsement of Trump, Trump said: These are people that punch. People that are violent people. The particular one where I said  I d like to bang him,  that was a very vicious   a guy who was swinging, very loud, and then started swinging at the audience. You know what? The audience swung back. And I thought it was very, very appropriate. He was swinging. He was hitting people. And the audience hit back. And that s what we need a little bit more of. This isn t all that surprising considering this is what he has said before: You know what I hate? There s a guy totally disruptive, throwing punches, we re not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the ol  days. You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Enough is enough, folks. Violence is never okay, and if you want to be the President of the United States, Trump, you can t just throw punches at our enemies if they don t agree with you. One of the scariest thoughts in the world right now is the thought of Trump with our nuclear codes.

 Joe Scarborough ADMITS That Trickle Down Economics Is A Total Republican Lie (VIDEO),"In a shocking moment of confession, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough admitted on the air that trickle down economics is a lie that only helped the rich get richer.In an effort to explain why so many conservatives are flocking to support Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Scarborough said on Tuesday that it s because Republicans have lied to their constituents for the last thirty years that wealth will trickle down to them if we help the wealthy by cutting taxes.This can be seen most clearly in the wealth gap, which has only widened over the last three decades, resulting in the top 1 percent owning more the nation s wealth than the bottom 50 percent of the population combined. The rich have gotten richer and the poor have only gotten poorer as the once mighty and prosperous American middle class is disappearing. The problem with the Republican Party over the past 30 years is they haven t   and I ll say, we haven t   developed a message that appeals to the working class Americans economically in a way that Donald Trump s does,  Scarborough said. We talk about cutting capital gains taxes that the 10,000 people that in the crowd cheering for Donald Trump, they are never going to get a capital gains cut because it doesn t apply. We talk about getting rid of the death tax. The death tax is not going to impact the 10,000 people in the crowd for Donald Trump. We talk about how great free trade deals are. Those free trade deals never trickle down to those 10,000 people in Donald Trump s rallies. And then the former Republican lawmaker actually flat-out admitted that trickle down hasn t worked. But herein lies the problem with the Republican Party. It never trickles down! Those people in Trump s crowds, those are all the ones that lost the jobs when they get moved to Mexico and elsewhere. The Republican donor class are the ones that got rich off of it because their capital moved overseas and they made higher profits What we re finding this year is, they ll even support a guy who says Planned Parenthood is good if he comes with an economic approach that they feel could actually help them more in the future. Here s the video via YouTube:And Scarborough is absolutely right. For decades, Republicans have told the American people that their economic concerns will be all taken care of as long as we eliminate taxes on the wealthy. But all that trickle down economics has caused is Americans losing their jobs overseas and they never see a dime of the wealth the GOP promised would trickle down upon them. It s like saying apples will fall from a tree if you just wait long enough but by the time one does fall it s rotten to the core and worthless. And that s if the tree doesn t just keep all the apples for itself like the wealthy are currently keeping all the money to themselves.The fact is that trickle down economics is a failed economic policy that needs to be ditched in favor of one that actually helps the American people. It s time for the rich to start paying their fair share and it s time for the middle class to rise again and take back the wealth that has been stolen by Republicans and their wealthy puppet masters.Featured image via screenshot",News,"Jan 1, 2016"
THERE’S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN: ISIS Gets Stunning WAKE UP CALL From General “Mad Dog” Mattis On Day One,"President Trump has mentioned in the past that he would like to see ISIS completely wiped out within 30 days of taking office. If Mattis  first day on the job was any indication, the president may just get his wish.In Iraq, Mattis continued to crush ISIS forces. One of the strikes, taking place in the city of Rutbah, eliminated a tactical unit, two weapons caches, a mortar and a vehicle. Strikes in the city of Beiji also demolished a unit and a vehicle, while another strike in Kisik blew up a building and a tactical unit.To cap it all off, Mattis oversaw two strikes against Mosul, the ISIS region capital in Iraq, which annihilated two units, a tank, a factory that manufactures car bombs, and three fighting positions.CNN Analyst retired Lt.

"LEAKED TAPE Exposes George Soros, Obama GROUP Planning To Infiltrate, DISRUPT Republican Town Hall Meetings, DEMAND Media Attention","James Proctor has been identified as the ringleader in the  radical group  Indivisible,  who can be heard directing the fake protesters on how to disrupt GOP town halls. In the audio, he can be heard giving the (likely paid) actors a few last minute tips before heading out:  Dress conservatively, behave conservatively, right? Look and dress like students, dress like housewife wear a suit and tie Any signifier that you re a liberal leave it. The recordings have been authenticated by KPEL News. James Proctor, who can be heard speaking in the recording, says he does live in the Acadiana area. Proctor says some of his comments were taken out of context as the published recording is only a portion of the hour and a half long meeting. He works with the group Indivisible Guide. The groups name can be heard on the recording of the meeting. Indivisible,  the George Soros spinoff outfit which is, along with Barack Obama s Organizing For America, collaborating to salt the town halls of Republican members of Congress with activists and agitators seeking to disrupt those town halls and make those members look bad on TV.

This reporter not only ignored both of those disgusting acts, she also goes to great lengths to discredit any idea that these people were organized. She even went as far as to attempt to make the viewers believe that some of these like minded people could have found out about this town hall meeting on a Facebook page:We, and other conservative media organizations in the state, received audio from someone   let s call him a concerned citizen   who sat in on an Indivisible meeting in Lafayette earlier this week wherein plans were being made to do the same thing to Cassidy tomorrow morning in Breaux Bridge.

Today EMILY s List, the nation s largest resource for women in politics, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Clinton is on track to become the first woman to win the Democratic nomination, and if elected, the first woman president of the United States. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president,  said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY s List.  With roots in the middle class, Hillary s top priority is changing the economic reality for American families. Her focus is on strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, and making sure hardworking families get a fair shot. No one will work harder than Hillary. She knows how to lead so Washington fights for all Americans. As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls (give them access to on demand abortions) and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career. The EMILY s List community   now more than three million members strong   is proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to fighting for women and families (supporting the killing of unborn babies). Instead of going to a big law firm after graduating from Yale Law School, she took her first job going door to door for the Children s Defense Fund. She helped lead the fight for the Children s Health Insurance Program as first lady of the United States, and she put emphasis on women s rights as a  cornerstone of American foreign policy  as Secretary of State.A visionary leader who s always worked to create opportunity for others, Hillary has said she believes  our challenge is to be clear-eyed about the world as it is while never losing sight of the world as we want it to become.

YOU GOTTA LOVE THIS: [VIDEO] White Girl Told She’s Not Allowed To Wear Dreadlocks To School,"Try telling a young black girl she can t wear dreadlocks to school  A Utah School has told a teenage student she can t wear dreadlocks to school, and now the mom is claiming discrimination. Except the student is lily-white.The Lincoln Academy in Pleasant Grove reprimanded eighth-grader Caycee Cunningham for wearing dreadlocks to school, saying it violates the school s dress code. Her mom, however, claims she wears them for  religious reasons,  Fox13Now is reporting.Caycee recently studied abroad in Guatemala and converted to Hinduism. She wears the dreadlocks as a result of that  spiritual journey,  mother Tonya Judd said.Students of other ethnicities are apparently allowed to wear dreadlocks, but her white daughter isn t.  My daughter is white and there happens to be other kids in the school who happen to be other race and ethnicity and they have hair that can t be combed, and there s never been an issue regarding that before,  Judd said. Principal Jake Hunt said the school s dress code doesn t specifically ban dreadlocks, but there are policies against  unnatural hair colors  and  distracting hair cuts  that all students must abide by.  Our dress code says that our students  hair must have a neat, combed appearance, be appropriate for school, and not be distracting in the classroom, which is pretty similar to what many schools in our area have,  he said.Principal Hunt said Caycee will not face any repercussions for continuing to wear dreadlocks, but she is in violation of school policy. Judd and Caycee said they will stand their ground and Caycee will continue to wear the dreadlocks and transfer schools if need be. Via: DownTrend  ",left-news,"October 27, 2016"
FBI Release Oregon Video Footage Depicting Death of Robert Lavoy Finicum – But Questions Remain,"21st Century Wire says..UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday brought on by a YouTube recording of the testimony of key eyewitness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports.The FBI has also titled their release as  unedited  which shows a window of 26 min and 29 seconds, but it would be interesting to see any drone footage prior to where their clip begins, to further determine how long the drone was filming the vehicles of Finicum and Bundy. This is important because it would shed further light the premeditated nature of the confrontation that the media and government  sources  have called a  traffic stop . On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.  WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing. Watch:Watch the edited version here:  Finicum appears to temporarily lose his balance in the snow at the very moment he looks to be hit by agents.What is clear however from this video is that armed agents did not shoot to disable their suspect, but shot to kill and even had a laser sight trained on him for many minutes after he was downed. Clearly, multiple SWAT shooters could be seen emerging from the woods. After killing Finicum, police then left the victim to bleed to death laying in the snow and did not check on him for at least another 8 minutes.Flash-bang rounds can be seen around the 14:00 mark of the FBI s  unedited  version, and the FBI has said that it fired CS gas and  non lethal rounds  (possibly pepper spray rounds, or rubber bullets) are said to have been fired at the truck while the passengers were inside. This begs the question: with nonlethal rounds already in play   why did multiple SWAT shooters use so many deadly rounds against Finicum when he exited the truck with his hands up?READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"September 9, 2017"
 WATCH: Republican Analyst Who Worked For Nixon Says Trump Is In Impeachment Territory,"If anybody knows when a president is qualified for impeachment, it s David Gergen.After all, he worked in the Nixon Administration.Donald Trump s Russia scandal has gotten even bigger over the last week. Just a day after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office and leaked highly classified information and compromised the source of that intelligence and our own national security.And now, there s a memo written by Comey noting that Trump asked him to drop the Russia investigation.Interestingly enough, it s the memo that could end up bringing Trump down.You see, asking the head of a federal agency to drop an investigation and then firing that person later on for refusing to do so is the very definition of obstruction of justice and impeding an investigation.As it turns out, obstruction of justice is what led to impeachment proceedings against former President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.Republican analyst David Gergen delivered that explanation during a segment on CNN on Tuesday.When Anderson Cooper asked Gergen to weigh in, the longtime Republican said that Trump has entered  impeachment territory. I was in the Nixon Administration as you know and I thought after watching the Clinton impeachment, I thought I would never see another one,  Gergen began.  But I think we re in impeachment territory for the first time. The obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Nixon that brought him down. Obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Bill Clinton,  Gergen continued. It looks like he was trying to impede the investigation. He was using his power to do that, and when James Comey didn t go along with him, when he wasn t his boy, he fired him This is of enormous consequence for his presidency. Gergen then concluded that all the bombshells dropped over the last week, including Comey s firing, sharing classified intelligence with the Russians, and the revelation that Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation are causing Trump s presidency to unravel. What we see is a presidency that s starting to come apart,  Gergen said.Here s the video via YouTube.It is now clear that Trump fired Comey because he refused to drop the investigation. That is obstruction of justice and should result in Trump being impeached. Of course, Republicans in Congress have no interest in impeaching Trump. That would require having the courage and a soul.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 17, 2017"
" Fox News Host Makes Mike Pence SQUIRM, Says He Is Just Trump’s ‘Clean Up Crew’","Donald Trump s running mate, Mike Pence, appeared on Fox News for an interview Sunday morning. Let s just say it did not go well for him. Host Chris Wallace hammered him about Trump s assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton  founded ISIS,  backing him into a corner and making him squirm. Ultimately, Wallace came to the conclusion that Pence is nothing more than Trump s  clean up crew. You and he spent a day defending his remarks, saying that they were serious,  Wallace began, playing the video.  Now, Trump says that he was being sarcastic. So, Governor, which is it? Well, I think he was being very serious, and he was making a point that needs to be made, that there is no question that the failed policies of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in the wider Middle East, created a vacuum within Iraq in which ISIS was able to arise,  Pence replied. So then why is he saying he was sarcastic?,  Wallace asked insistently. Well, he was making a very serious point, and look ,  Pence responded,Wallace was not about to let Pence off the hook and asked again,  Forgive me, why did he say he was being sarcastic? Well, he was making a very serious point. Donald Trump has a way of talking to get people s attention, and it s drawn attention to a very important issue,  Pence replied. There was a time when any Democrat president knew where the buck stopped in the White House,  Pence continued.  And the responsibility for the failed policies in the Middle East that created the environment where ISIS developed belongs to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the American people know that. Governor, those are all perfectly legitimate points to make, but that isn t what Trump said. He said that Obama and Clinton were the most valuable players of ISIS, that they were the co-founders of ISIS,  Wallace said.  Then he said, well, I was just being sarcastic about that, just as he said he was just being sarcastic about inviting Russia to come in and release e-mails of Hillary Clinton s. Isn t the sarcastic excuse getting a bit old?,  Wallace asked directly. Well, no, I don t think it s getting old at all, Chris,  Pence stammered.  Donald Trump made his way through a very competitive primary because he spoke not like your typical politician, but just plainly like an everyday American. And speaking plainly is exactly what the American people will anticipate in the course of this election, but more importantly, they re going to have a president who tells them exactly what s on his mind, and the American people are going to hear and hear him loudly. Finally, after pinning Pence down and listening to the steady stream of bullshit the VP was feeding him, Wallace said screw it and asked the former Indiana governor the only question left: Are you the cleanup crew?

 Schumer Breaks It Down: Explains Why Trump Hasn’t Accomplished Sh*t (VIDEO),"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer broke things down on Sunday and explained why it is that Donald Trump hasn t been able to accomplish squat so far.Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Schumer gave a scathing review of Trump s first 100 days, which he said had  hardly been a success.  He laid into Trump for his litany of broken promises, including his failed health care bill and decision to add more monsters to the swamp rather than draining it. There s been promise after promise that s been either unfulfilled or broken,  he said. The bottom line is very simple: the president, if he works with us, particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure, we can work. But on the issues so far, taxes and healthcare, he doesn t consult us at all. According to Schumer, Trump comes up with a plan that s very hard right  and then tells Democrats that supporting the plan is the only  way to be bipartisan. That s not how America works,  Schumer said.The Senate minority leader then scorched Trump on his failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He pointed out that Trump didn t need a single Democrat to vote for his bill in order to pass it. And it still failed miserably. He s not governing from the middle, he s governing from the hard right. That s why his regime has had hardly any major successes, with the exception of Gorsuch. If he changes, we can work together. But he can t just dictate what he wants,  Schumer said. The country doesn t work my way or the highway. Trump, for his part, spent the weekend attacking Democrats, Schumer in specific. On Saturday, Trump slammed Schumer as  a bad leader.  On Sunday, he said that without a leader,  Democrats  have become the party of obstruction.  He then continued that theme during an interview with Face The Nation on Sunday morning.You can watch Schumer s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2017"

YALE Will Tack New Fee Onto Already Outrageous Tuition Costs To Help Fight Phony Climate Change,"It s amazing the sheep mentality of students attending a school that should be promoting individual thought and encouraging students to not buy into propaganda without first exploring the facts.The price of carbon dioxide emissions could be the next thing to drive up the cost of a university education, as Ivy Leaguers at Yale plan to set precedent by becoming the first school in the U.S. to enact a campus-wide  carbon charge  after signing a pledge at the White House earlier this week.More than 200 universities attended a White House climate change summit Thursday to sign a pledge on taking steps to transition to a low-carbon economy and reduce the effects of global warming. Many scientists blame greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, for raising the Earth s temperature, causing more severe weather, droughts and coastal flooding.President Obama has been enlisting academic institutions and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions in the runup to a major United Nations climate conference in Paris Nov. 30. Obama intends to agree to a deal there that would commit the U.S. to reducing its emissions 26-28 percent by 2030.Thursday s pledge reads:  Today our school pledges to accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy while enhancing sustainable and resilient practices across our campuses.  Although it does not obligate campuses to enact so-called  carbon charges,  Yale University has chosen to begin testing out the idea this year.On Friday, Yale said the pledge  renews the university s commitment to maintaining a leadership role  on climate change. It notes that in 2005, the university established itself as a  global leader for climate change action  with an aggressive target of reducing greenhouse gases by 43 percent by 2020. And to that end, it announced a series of practices that includes the launch of a  campus-wide, internal carbon charge experiment. Based on a report issued earlier this year by Yale, the charge appears to be derived from an economic model the White House has developed called the  social cost of carbon  metric. Republicans have criticized the administration s use of the metric in creating costly regulations to reduce emissions, saying the White House has not been transparent in the creation of the metric. In September 2014, Yale convened the Presidential Carbon Charge Task Force to consider whether it would be feasible and effective to institute a university-wide carbon charge,  the university said.  Based on the task force s recommendation, and consistent with Yale s policy of leading by example on sustainability, Yale will soon announce a campus-wide plan for testing internal carbon charge mechanisms. The task force said Yale would implement a pilot project on carbon pricing. The task force s report said the charge on carbon dioxide emissions would provide incentives for decision makers to reduce reliance on  carbon-intensive activities.
